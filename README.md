African Languages Wordlist Repository

## Description
This repository aims to create and document a Mnemonic wordlist for the [bip39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) using African Languages.

### Wordlist Rules
The general wordlist rules are documented in the [official github docs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki#Wordlist)

In addition to these rules, some specific rules should apply to languages, such as:

***Note***: *The word list can contain native characters, but they must be encoded in UTF-8 using Normalisation Form Compatibility Decomposition (NFKD)*.

Listed below are African Languages for which a wordlist is currently under development, along with some specific rules that guides this process.

#### Language: **Yoruba**
    - Words can be uniquely determined by typing the first 4 characters (sometimes less).
    - Only words with 4-8 letters.
    - No numeral adjectives.
    - No words with more than one synonyms to make it easy to identify the words.
    - No words with double vocals (like: ogun).
